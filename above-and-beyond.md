# Above and Beyond: Initiative & Problem-Solving

This section showcases real-world examples of proactive problem-solving, team consideration, and going beyond standard job requirements. These experiences demonstrate the initiative and critical thinking skills essential for cybersecurity roles.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Emergency Network Infrastructure Protection During Critical Business Hours**

**Situation:** During a scheduled network maintenance window at one of our hotel properties, the primary internet connection failed unexpectedly, threatening to disrupt guest services during peak business hours.

**Challenge:** 
- Critical business-hour disruption imminent
- Guest Wi-Fi and operational systems at risk
- Standard escalation procedures would take hours
- No immediate backup connectivity solution in place

**Initiative Taken:**
Rather than following standard escalation protocols that would have left the site offline for several hours, I immediately:

1. **Rapid Assessment:** Conducted remote diagnostics to isolate the failure to the ISP connection rather than internal infrastructure
2. **Creative Solution:** Identified that the site's backup 4G connection (normally used only for monitoring) could be temporarily reconfigured to handle guest traffic
3. **Immediate Implementation:** Remotely reconfigured the Meraki firewall to:
   - Route guest Wi-Fi traffic through the 4G backup
   - Prioritise critical operational systems
   - Implement bandwidth management to ensure stable service
4. **Proactive Communication:** Immediately informed both the hotel management and our operations team of the temporary solution and expected resolution timeline

**Impact:**
- **Zero guest impact** - Wi-Fi remained operational throughout the incident
- **Business continuity maintained** - All critical systems continued functioning
- **Cost avoidance** - Prevented potential revenue loss during peak occupancy period
- **Team efficiency** - Allowed primary support team to focus on permanent fix without emergency pressure

**Technical Skills Demonstrated:**
- Network troubleshooting under pressure
- Creative problem-solving with existing infrastructure
- Remote configuration management
- Understanding of business priorities and impact

**Lessons Learned:**
- Importance of having pre-configured emergency procedures
- Value of understanding the full capability of backup systems
- Critical nature of immediate communication during incidents

## üí° **Key Principles Demonstrated**

### **Proactive Problem-Solving**
Rather than simply escalating issues, I analyse root causes and implement creative solutions using available resources.

### **Business Impact Awareness**
Understanding that technical problems have real business consequences drives urgency and solution prioritisation.

### **Team Consideration**
Taking immediate action relieves pressure on colleagues and allows for more thoughtful long-term solutions.

### **Communication Excellence**
Keeping all stakeholders informed prevents confusion and demonstrates professional reliability.
