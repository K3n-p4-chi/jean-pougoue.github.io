## üëã Hello and Welcome!

My name is **Jean Pougoue**, and I'm a Network & System Engineer based in the UK, currently working at KCP Network where I manage infrastructure across 70 hotel sites supporting thousands of users daily. But that's just the beginning of my story.

This blog chronicles my journey from network engineering to **Cloud Cyber Security Engineering** ‚Äì a deliberate, systematic transformation that I'm documenting in real-time to help others follow a similar path.

## üéØ What This Blog Is About

**Cloud Security Career Transformation** ‚Äì I'm sharing every step of my transition from traditional network engineering into cloud security, including:
