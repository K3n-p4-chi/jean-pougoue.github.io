## 👋 Hello and Welcome!

My name is **Jean Pougoue**, and I'm a Network & System Engineer based in the UK, currently working at KCP Network where I manage infrastructure across 70 hotel sites supporting thousands of users daily. But that's just the beginning of my story.

This blog chronicles my journey from network engineering to **Cloud Cyber Security Engineering** – a deliberate, systematic transformation that I'm documenting in real-time to help others follow a similar path.

## 🎯 What This Blog Is About

**Cloud Security Career Transformation** – I'm sharing every step of my transition from traditional network engineering into cloud security, including:

- **Certification Journey** – Real study plans, practice scores, and honest assessments
- **Technical Skills Development** – From PowerShell scripts to Python automation
- **Hands-on Labs** – Home lab configurations and cloud experiments
- **Career Strategy** – Job applications, interviews, and professional development
- **Automation Projects** – Building a portfolio of practical cloud security tools

**Real Data, Real Progress** – You won't find generic advice here. I'm sharing actual practice test scores, study schedules that work (and don't work), budget tracking, and genuine challenges encountered along the way.

## 🏗️ My Current Foundation

**Technical Experience:**
- 5+ years in network infrastructure and cloud migration
- Daily management of Microsoft 365/Entra ID environments
